= constexpr

The `constexpr` keyword, originally introduced in {cpp}, has been adopted into C starting with the C23 standard. However, the {cpp} version of `constexpr` is significantly more powerful and versatile.

#include <stddef.h>

void foo(void) {
    constexpr int MAX_SIZE = 3 * 3;
    int array[MAX_SIZE];  // MAX_SIZE is evaluated at compile-time.

    // manually compute squares table
    constexpr int table[] = { 0*0, 1*1, 2*2, 3*3, 4*4, 5*5, 6*6, 7*7, 8*8 };
    constexpr size_t numEntries = sizeof(table)/sizeof(table[0]);
}

#include <array>

constexpr int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}

template<std::size_t N>
constexpr std::array<int, N> generateSquaredLookUpTable() {
    std::array<int, N> array;
    for( std::size_t k = 0; k < N; ++k ) {
        array[k] = square(k);
    }
    return array;
}

void foo() {
    constexpr int MAX_SIZE = square(3);
    int arr[MAX_SIZE];  // MAX_SIZE is evaluated at compile-time.

    constexpr auto table = generateSquaredLookUpTable<square(3)>(); // The table is built at compile-time.
    constexpr std::size_t numEntries = table.size(); // numEntries is evaluated at compile-time.
}

NOTE: Unlike C preprocessor macros, which are limited to simple text substitution, the C++ `constexpr` function `generateSquaredLookUpTable()` allows for complex compile-time computations and initialization. This demonstrates the added power and flexibility of `constexpr` over traditional macros.

== TL;DR
Use `constexpr` to enable compile-time computation whenever possible.

In C23, `constexpr` is a type-safe replacement for `#define` constants, while in C++, it extends to functions and constructors, offering greater flexibility and optimization opportunities.

== C23
In C23, `constexpr` can be applied only to variables. It guarantees that the variable's value is evaluated at compile-time, making it a safer and more robust alternative to `#define` macros for constants.

* **Compile-Time Evaluation**: Ensures the value is evaluated at compile-time.
* **Replacement for `#define`**: Offers type safety and scope rules.
* **No Function Support**: `constexpr` in C23 does not support functions.

== {cpp}
In {cpp}, `constexpr` is much more versatile and powerful. Introduced in {cpp}11 and extended in later standards, `constexpr` can be applied to both variables and functions, allowing for more extensive compile-time evaluation and optimization.

. **Compile-Time Function Evaluation**: In {cpp}, `constexpr` can be applied to functions, allowing them to be evaluated at compile-time if their inputs are constant expressions. This enables the creation of highly efficient code by reducing runtime computation.
. **Versatile Use**: `constexpr` can be used for variables, functions, and constructors, making it a critical tool for writing efficient and optimized code.
. **Constant Expression Enforcement**: A `constexpr` function or variable must be evaluated at compile-time if possible, which can lead to significant optimizations, especially in performance-critical code like embedded systems.
