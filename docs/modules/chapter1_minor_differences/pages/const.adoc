== TL;DR
In C, `const` is often used for read-only variables and pointers, but its usage is limited.

In {cpp}, `const` is more integral, applying to variables, pointers, and member functions, promoting link:https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/const-correctness[const-correctness]. This means you can more precisely control which parts of your code are immutable, leading to safer, more predictable code and improved optimization opportunities.

== C
. **Read-only variables:** Once a `const` variable is initialized, its value cannot be changed. For example, `const int x = 100;`

. **Pointers:** `const` can specify whether the pointer itself or the data it points to is read-only, or both:
  * `const char* strLiteral = "literal";` - pointer can change, data can't
  * `char* const fixedPtr = mutableString;` - pointer can't change, data can
  * `const char* const fixed = "literal";` - pointer can't change, data also can't

. **Linkage:** By default, file-scoped `const` variables in C have internal linkage. To make them accessible across multiple files, `extern` must be used.

== {cpp}
. **Read-only variables:** Same as in C.

. **Pointers:** Same as in C.

. **Member Functions:** A member function can be declared as `const`, meaning it does not modify the state of the object. For example, `int getValue() const;` ensures that calling `getValue()` will not change any member variables of the class.

class Foo {
public:
    void nonMutatingFunction() const;
    void mutatingFunction();
};

const Foo values[5];

for( const auto& v : values ) {
    v.nonMutatingFunction(); // v is a constant reference to a Foo object
    v.mutatingFunction(); // this will not compile as mutatingFunction could change v
}

. **Const-Correctness:** {cpp} emphasizes using `const` wherever possible to prevent unintended modifications. This leads to safer and more predictable code.

. **Linkage:** Unlike in C, file-scoped `const` variables in {cpp} have external linkage by default, allowing them to be shared across multiple translation units unless explicitly declared as `static`.

NOTE: Const variables with external linkage can be declared in a header file and defined in a single source file, making them accessible across multiple files.

== Why?

The extensive use of `const` in {cpp} encourages safer programming practices by reducing unintended side effects and clarifying code intentions. It also allows the compiler to better enforce constness and make optimizations.
