= Implicit Return Type

[source,c,indent=0]
----
function(int x) {
    return x + 5;
}
----

== TL;DR
All {cpp} standards and C standards post-C89 require functions to explicitly specify their return type. Implicit return types are no longer supported.

== What?
In C89, if a function didn't specify a return type, it was implicitly treated as returning `int`. This behavior dates back to earlier versions of C, where `void` was not a recognized type, and thus all functions defaulted to returning `int`. However, starting with C99 and in all {cpp} standards, omitting the return type results in a compile-time error. This change enforces clearer and more predictable code by mandating explicit return type declarations.

== C89 Example
The following is a valid C89 program:

.main.c
[source,c,indent=0]
----
#include <stdio.h>

function(int x) {
    return x + 5;
}

int main(void) {
    int result;
    result = function(5);
    printf("result: %d\r\n", result);
    return 0;
}
----

Build & run with:
[source,bash]
----
$ gcc -std=c89 main.c && ./a.out
----
