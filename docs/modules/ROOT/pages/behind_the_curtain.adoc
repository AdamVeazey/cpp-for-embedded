= Behind The Curtain

This section offers a different way of looking at familiar constructs. By considering these syntax examples from a fresh perspective, you'll be better prepared to understand more complex C and {cpp} concepts, such as copy/move semantics and recognizing value categories.

== Syntax Sugar: It's Already There

Before diving into {cpp}, it's important to recognize that you're already using syntax sugar in C. Features like `else if` and operators are syntactic shortcuts that simplify code, making it easier to read and write without necessarily adding any cost. {cpp} simply provides more of these tools, which can make code even more expressive.

== else if

=== TL;DR
There isn't really such a thing as an `else if` statement in C or {cpp}. It's just an `if` statement inside an `else` block with minimal whitespace between `else` and `if`. The `else if` you're familiar with is simply taking advantage of this syntactic shortcut.

=== Explanation
If this doesn't make sense yet, let's walk through it.

Recall that without `{}`, an `if` or `else` contains only a single statement:
[source,c]
----
if( condition1 )
    condition1 = false;
----

Now let's work through how `else if` is built:

. Example code
+
[source,c]
----
if( condition1 ) {
    // do thing 1
}
else {
    if( condition2 ) {
        // do thing 2
    }
    else {
        // do thing 3
    }
}
----
. Remove the braces around the `else`
+
[source,c]
----
if( condition1 ) {
    // do thing 1
}
else // only the next statement is part of this else block
    if( condition2 ) {
        // do thing 2
    }
    else {
        // do thing 3
    }
----
. Adjust whitespace for readability
+
[source,c]
----
if( condition1 ) {
    // do thing 1
}
else if( condition2 ) {
    // do thing 2
}
else {
    // do thing 3
}
----

Recognizing that `else if` is simply an `else` followed by an `if` was most likely your first introduction to syntactic sugar. Understanding this helps you appreciate how syntax sugar enhances the readability and maintainability of code.

== Operators: Inline Functions in Disguise

Operators in C and {cpp} can be mentally modeled as if they're functions with special syntax designed to reduce visual clutter. They can be categorized into three types:

. Unary - operates on one operand
. Binary - operates on two operands
. Ternary - operates on three operands

The key takeaway here is that operators are a more concise way to represent what could otherwise be written as functions. Understanding how they would look as functions helps you make better decisions about when certain operators might introduce extra work—like post-increment—and when their cost is minimal.

=== Unary operators

Unary operators act on a single operand. These examples show what pre- and post-decrement might look like if they were functions.

.Example: Pre-decrement vs Post-decrement
[source,c]
----
int data = -1;

--data; // subtract 1 from data, return result
inline int operator_predecrement(int& value) {
    value -= 1;
    return value;
}
operator_predecrement(data); // equivalent to --data

data--; // copy data, subtract 1, return the copy
inline int operator_postdecrement(int& value) {
    int tmp = value;
    value -= 1;
    return tmp;
}
operator_postdecrement(data); // equivalent to data--
----
In this case, post-decrement requires an extra copy of the value before modification. This is an example of hidden work that understanding the underlying mechanics can reveal. Most compilers are smart enough to optimize out the copy when it's unnecessary, like performing post-increment on an index variable in a `for` loop.

=== Binary operators

Binary operators involve two operands. They are the most common type of operator in C and {cpp}.

.Example: Addition and Addition-Assignment
[source,c]
----
int value = -1;

value = value + 3 + 2; // (add value to 3, return temporary) then add 2 to temporary)
inline int operator_add(int leftHandSide, int rightHandSide) {
    return leftHandSide + rightHandSide;
}
value = operator_add(operator_add(value, 3), 2); // same as `value = value + 3 + 2`

value += 3; // add 3 to value and store the result in value
inline int& operator_addAssignment(int& leftHandSide, int rightHandSide) {
    leftHandSide = leftHandSide + rightHandSide;
    return leftHandSide;
}
operator_addAssignment(value, 3); // same as `value += 3`
----
The addition and addition-assignment operators can be thought of as syntax sugar for function calls that either return a result or modify the variable in place.

In the first example, chaining multiple function calls adds a lot of visual clutter, making it harder to understand what the code is doing. Using the syntax sugar `+` allows for much clearer intent.

Similarly, in the case of addition-assignment, the function version isn't as obvious at first glance that `value` is being modified. Again, the syntax sugar `+=` makes this clearer.

=== Ternary operators

Ternary operators take three operands. The conditional operator is the only ternary operator in C and {cpp}, and it's often referred to simply as **__the__** ternary operator. It's a compact `if` statement that returns one of two values based on a condition.

TIP: Use the ternary operator for short, simple conditions that require returning an expression. If the logic gets complicated, switch to an `if-else` statement for clarity.

[source,c++]
----
const char* s = isCondition ? "valueIfTrue" : "valueIfFalse";
inline const char* operator_ternaryString(
    bool condition,
    const char* valueIfTrue,
    const char* valueIfFalse
) {
    if(condition) {
        return valueIfTrue;
    }
    return valueIfFalse;
}
const char* value = operator_ternaryString(isCondition, "valueIfTrue", "valueIfFalse");
----
The ternary operator is just a concise way of writing a conditional statement. Once you see the operator for the first time, you might wonder why not just use an `if`? But its utility lies in encoding intent concisely in simpler cases, reducing visual clutter from the main idea that can easily be seen in a single line.

== Array Indexing Operator []

The array indexing operator `[]` is a binary operator where the operands are an address and an offset. Normally, you write it as `address[offset]`, but due to pointer arithmetic rules, you can swap the operands and write `offset[address]`.

For example:
[source,c]
----
int array[4];
0[array] = 10; // exactly the same as array[0] = 10
----
The normal access: +
`array[0]` +
Can be rewritten as: +
`*(array + 0)` +
Or even as: +
`*(0 + array)` +
And, using the array indexing operator: +
`0[array]` +

Additionally, this is also why the name of an array itself is the same as a pointer to the first element of the array, as the `+ 0` offset can be removed by simplifying the equation. +
`*(array + 0)` +
Is the same as +
`*array` +

WARNING: Stick to the conventional `array[index]` for readability. This example is meant to demonstrate that even operators as familiar as array indexing could be argued to also be syntax sugar.
